## About The Project

Habit Helper aims to help users find a healthier balance with their digital devices. When the urge to scroll hits, this site offers a curated list of simple, often screen-free activities that can be started immediately to provide a mindful break, a creative spark, or a moment of productivity.

The core idea is to make choosing an alternative as easy as possible, turning potential wasted time into moments well spent. This project served as a practical exercise for me to solidify concepts in React functional components, state management, routing, and styling with Tailwind CSS within a fast Vite development environment.
