# Habit Helper

Habit Helper is a React-based project designed to help users discover simple, refreshing activities to replace endless scrolling on their phones. This project is a part of my learning journey and is intended to help me track my progress in React and modern web development. It is not a production-ready application but rather a way to practice and experiment with new concepts and technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building reusable components and managing the application's state.
- **React Router**: For implementing client-side routing and navigation between pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For writing modern, clean, and efficient code.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.

## Concepts Learned

1. **React Component Architecture**: Learned how to structure and organize reusable components.
2. **React Router**: Gained experience in setting up routes and navigation for a single-page application.
3. **State Management**: Managed state and props effectively across components.
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Improved my skills in styling components using utility classes.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
6. **SVG Icons**: Integrated scalable vector graphics for a modern and clean UI.
